# URLDump
Firefox Extension to dump all opened Tabs and save to txt file

## How does it work - 

- **Download** - Save checked tabs to txt file only.

- **Download all** - Save all the tabs to txt file (works without checkbox).

- **Upload File** - Upload already created text file with links to open all of them.

## Installation

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rohinish404/rdump.git
  cd rdump
```

- Go to `about:debugging` > `This Firefox` in Firefox 
  
- Click Load Temporary Add-on and select URLDump manifest file.

Now you can use it.
